# FuzzyTail

This MATLAB project implements a control system for an aircraft’s vertical flight angle using the rear control surface angle, based on fuzzy logic using MATLAB's Fuzzy Toolbox and Simulink

# Description

FuzzyTail is a flight angle control system where the user inputs a desired angle, and a Mamdani fuzzy controller—with at least 5 fuzzy sets automatically adjusts the rear control surface angle to achieve the target trajectory.
